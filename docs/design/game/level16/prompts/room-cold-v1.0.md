## 完整提示词

```text
Create an isometric pixel art EXPANSIVE yoga studio with floor-to-ceiling windows in hi-bit style, inspired by games like Eastward or Coffee Talk. This is a feng shui puzzle game scene showing a room with problematic energy flow before corrections.

ROOM SCALE: EXPANSIVE (~100 square meters, large wellness studio with multiple practice zones)

The room is viewed from a 45-degree isometric angle, showing depth and dimension. This is the LARGEST single-room space yet - a professional yoga studio with expansive floor-to-ceiling windows on one side. The ultra-wide canvas shows: main practice area with yoga mat positions, a meditation corner, storage for props, changing room entrance, and reception/check-in area. The space should feel open but with subtle energy problems.

SPATIAL COMPLEXITY: Professional wellness facility with 5+ distinct zones. The overwhelming window area creates light imbalance. Dark corners exist despite the openness. Structural columns create sharp corner issues. The wealth corner is in a problematic location. A door to the changing area brings in yin/water energy.

SCENE CONTEXT:
This is a "瑜伽工作室" scenario. The room has a stagnant energy atmosphere with Cloudy stagnant lighting. The space feels energetically imbalanced - not disastrously messy, but with subtle visual cues that something feels "off" about the layout.

CRITICAL SPATIAL LAYOUT - FOLLOW EXACTLY:

ZONE A - YOGA AREA:
- Yoga space
- CRITICAL: YIN SHA (too much)

ZONE B - CORNER:
- Sharp corner
- CRITICAL: SHARP CORNER

ZONE C - WINDOW:
- Large window
- CRITICAL: WINDOW SHA

ZONE D - WEALTH:
- Wealth area
- CRITICAL: WEALTH SHA

ZONE E - ENTRANCE:
- Smell from changing room
- CRITICAL: SMELL SHA

FLOOR AND SURFACE DETAILS (Controlled Clutter):
- Yoga mats (rolled)
- Minimal items

VISUAL STYLE SPECIFICATIONS:
- Art Style: Hi-bit pixel art with clean, crisp pixels and defined edges
- Color Palette: Cool, desaturated tones - muted blues, grey-greens, cold whites, desaturated browns
- Lighting: Cloudy stagnant - creating subtle shadows and a slightly oppressive mood
- Atmosphere: stagnant energy - the room feels emotionally heavy but not filthy
- Texture: Visible pixel texture with deliberate, artistic dithering patterns

TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS:
- NO human characters or animals (furniture and objects only)
- NO text, labels, or UI elements
- NO glowing markers or indicators
- NO watermarks or signatures
- Room should look "lived-in but energetically imbalanced" rather than "disgustingly messy"

OUTPUT: Single 16:9 isometric pixel art image.
