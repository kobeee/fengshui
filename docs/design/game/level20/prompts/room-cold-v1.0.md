## 完整提示词

```text
Create an isometric pixel art EXPANSIVE ultimate challenge multi-zone space in hi-bit style, inspired by games like Eastward or Coffee Talk. This is a feng shui puzzle game scene showing a room with problematic energy flow before corrections.

ROOM SCALE: EXPANSIVE (~150 square meters, complex multi-functional space combining living, sleeping, and work areas)

The room is viewed from a 45-degree isometric angle, showing depth and dimension. This is the FINAL CHALLENGE - the largest and most complex space in the game. The ultra-wide canvas shows a large open-plan area that combines: a sleeping zone, a living area, a work corner, kitchen facilities, and large windows. The space has accumulated multiple severe feng shui problems from years of neglect.

SPATIAL COMPLEXITY: Master-level space with 7+ distinct zones and maximum sha variety. A beam crosses over the bed. A mirror faces the sleeping area. External buildings visible through windows create sky split sha. A road outside creates road clash and reverse bow sha. Multiple doors create door clash. The wealth corner is completely neglected. Dark corners exist in multiple locations. This is the ultimate test combining all sha types learned throughout the game.

SCENE CONTEXT:
This is a "风水大考" scenario. The room has a chaotic imbalanced atmosphere with Extremely oppressive lighting. The space feels energetically imbalanced - not disastrously messy, but with subtle visual cues that something feels "off" about the layout.

CRITICAL SPATIAL LAYOUT - FOLLOW EXACTLY:

ZONE A - BED:
- Bed under beam
- CRITICAL: BEAM SHA

ZONE B - MIRROR:
- Mirror facing bed
- CRITICAL: MIRROR SHA

ZONE C - WINDOW:

- CRITICAL: SKY SPLIT SHA

ZONE D - ROAD:

ZONE E - DOORS:

ZONE F - WEALTH:
- Cluttered wealth area

ZONE G - CORNER:
- Dark corner
- CRITICAL: YIN SHA

FLOOR AND SURFACE DETAILS (Controlled Clutter):
- Various items showing multiple problems

VISUAL STYLE SPECIFICATIONS:
- Art Style: Hi-bit pixel art with clean, crisp pixels and defined edges
- Color Palette: Cool, desaturated tones - muted blues, grey-greens, cold whites, desaturated browns
- Lighting: Extremely oppressive - creating subtle shadows and a slightly oppressive mood
- Atmosphere: chaotic imbalanced - the room feels emotionally heavy but not filthy
- Texture: Visible pixel texture with deliberate, artistic dithering patterns

TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS:
- NO human characters or animals (furniture and objects only)
- NO text, labels, or UI elements
- NO glowing markers or indicators
- NO watermarks or signatures
- Room should look "lived-in but energetically imbalanced" rather than "disgustingly messy"

OUTPUT: Single 16:9 isometric pixel art image.
