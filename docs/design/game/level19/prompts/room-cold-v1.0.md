## 完整提示词

```text
Create an isometric pixel art EXPANSIVE CEO executive office suite in hi-bit style, inspired by games like Eastward or Coffee Talk. This is a feng shui puzzle game scene showing a room with problematic energy flow before corrections.

ROOM SCALE: EXPANSIVE (~100 square meters, corner executive office with panoramic views)

The room is viewed from a 45-degree isometric angle, showing depth and dimension. This is a PRESTIGIOUS CORNER OFFICE - the ultra-wide canvas shows a large executive desk, a meeting area with sofas, floor-to-ceiling corner windows with city views, private bathroom entrance, and display shelving for awards. The scale conveys power and success, but multiple feng shui problems exist.

SPATIAL COMPLEXITY: Executive suite with 5+ functional zones. The desk faces away from the door (back door sha). External buildings visible through windows create wall blade sha. The wealth corner is cluttered with files. A ceiling beam crosses above the meeting area. Large windows create glare issues. An ensuite bathroom door creates smell sha. This is a master-level space with interconnected problems.

SCENE CONTEXT:
This is a "企业老板办公室" scenario. The room has a powerful but imbalanced atmosphere with Harsh executive lighting. The space feels energetically imbalanced - not disastrously messy, but with subtle visual cues that something feels "off" about the layout.

CRITICAL SPATIAL LAYOUT - FOLLOW EXACTLY:

ZONE A - DESK:
- Executive desk
- CRITICAL: BACK TO DOOR

ZONE B - WINDOW:
- Large window
- CRITICAL: WALL BLADE SHA (external)

ZONE C - WEALTH:
- Wealth corner
- CRITICAL: WEALTH SHA

ZONE D - BEAM:
- Ceiling beam
- CRITICAL: BEAM SHA

ZONE E - WINDOW/BATHROOM:
- Harsh light and bathroom door
- CRITICAL: WINDOW SHA and SMELL SHA

FLOOR AND SURFACE DETAILS (Controlled Clutter):
- Executive items
- Minimal clutter

VISUAL STYLE SPECIFICATIONS:
- Art Style: Hi-bit pixel art with clean, crisp pixels and defined edges
- Color Palette: Cool, desaturated tones - muted blues, grey-greens, cold whites, desaturated browns
- Lighting: Harsh executive - creating subtle shadows and a slightly oppressive mood
- Atmosphere: powerful but imbalanced - the room feels emotionally heavy but not filthy
- Texture: Visible pixel texture with deliberate, artistic dithering patterns

TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS:
- NO human characters or animals (furniture and objects only)
- NO text, labels, or UI elements
- NO glowing markers or indicators
- NO watermarks or signatures
- Room should look "lived-in but energetically imbalanced" rather than "disgustingly messy"

OUTPUT: Single 16:9 isometric pixel art image.
