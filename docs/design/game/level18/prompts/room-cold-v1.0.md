## 完整提示词

```text
Create an isometric pixel art EXPANSIVE luxury villa living room in hi-bit style, inspired by games like Eastward or Coffee Talk. This is a feng shui puzzle game scene showing a room with problematic energy flow before corrections.

ROOM SCALE: EXPANSIVE (~120 square meters, grand villa living room with multiple seating areas)

The room is viewed from a 45-degree isometric angle, showing depth and dimension. This is the GRANDEST SPACE in the game - a palatial villa living room with: multiple seating areas, a grand entrance with double doors, large windows showing external threats (road, buildings), a prominent fireplace, and connecting doorways to other rooms. The ultra-wide canvas shows the full scale of luxury but with multiple external sha sources visible through windows.

SPATIAL COMPLEXITY: Elite residential space with 6+ distinct zones. The main entrance faces a direct road (road clash visible through window). External buildings create sky split sha through the main window. A curved road outside creates reverse bow sha. The wealth corner is poorly utilized. Multiple doors create door clash issues. The fireplace creates fire element imbalance. This level introduces external sha that must be seen through windows.

SCENE CONTEXT:
This is a "别墅客厅" scenario. The room has a externally threatened atmosphere with Cold threatened lighting. The space feels energetically imbalanced - not disastrously messy, but with subtle visual cues that something feels "off" about the layout.

CRITICAL SPATIAL LAYOUT - FOLLOW EXACTLY:

ZONE A - ENTRANCE:
- Main entrance
- CRITICAL: ROAD CLASH (outside)

ZONE B - WINDOW:
- Large window
- CRITICAL: SKY SPLIT SHA (external buildings)
- CRITICAL: REVERSE BOW SHA (curved road)

ZONE C - WEALTH:
- Wealth corner
- CRITICAL: WEALTH SHA

ZONE D - DOORS:
- Back door
- CRITICAL: DOOR CLASH

ZONE E - FIREPLACE:
- Fireplace
- CRITICAL: FIREPLACE SHA

FLOOR AND SURFACE DETAILS (Controlled Clutter):
- Minimal elegant items
- Some decorations

VISUAL STYLE SPECIFICATIONS:
- Art Style: Hi-bit pixel art with clean, crisp pixels and defined edges
- Color Palette: Cool, desaturated tones - muted blues, grey-greens, cold whites, desaturated browns
- Lighting: Cold threatened - creating subtle shadows and a slightly oppressive mood
- Atmosphere: externally threatened - the room feels emotionally heavy but not filthy
- Texture: Visible pixel texture with deliberate, artistic dithering patterns

TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS:
- NO human characters or animals (furniture and objects only)
- NO text, labels, or UI elements
- NO glowing markers or indicators
- NO watermarks or signatures
- Room should look "lived-in but energetically imbalanced" rather than "disgustingly messy"

OUTPUT: Single 16:9 isometric pixel art image.
