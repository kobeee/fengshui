## 完整提示词

```text
Create an isometric pixel art LARGE modern loft apartment with visible upper level in hi-bit style, inspired by games like Eastward or Coffee Talk. This is a feng shui puzzle game scene showing a room with problematic energy flow before corrections.

ROOM SCALE: LARGE (~70 square meters, two-level loft with high ceilings)

The room is viewed from a 45-degree isometric angle, showing depth and dimension. This is a SIGNIFICANTLY LARGER space - a modern loft with DOUBLE-HEIGHT CEILING and a visible upper level/bedroom loft. The wider canvas shows multiple distinct functional zones: entrance area, kitchen zone, living area, and the upper sleeping loft connected by a staircase.

SPATIAL COMPLEXITY: Multi-level architecture with a prominent staircase connecting ground floor to upper loft. The high ceiling creates dramatic vertical space, and the open floor plan shows at least 4 distinct zones. This is the first level where verticality becomes a factor in the spatial layout.

SCENE CONTEXT:
This is a "开放式Loft" scenario. The room has a chaotic energy flow atmosphere with Overcast cold lighting. The space feels energetically imbalanced - not disastrously messy, but with subtle visual cues that something feels "off" about the layout.

CRITICAL SPATIAL LAYOUT - FOLLOW EXACTLY:

ZONE A - STAIRS:
- Staircase visible
- CRITICAL: STAIR CLASH

ZONE B - KITCHEN:
- Stove position
- CRITICAL: KITCHEN SHA

ZONE C - LIVING:
- Multiple energy issues

FLOOR AND SURFACE DETAILS (Controlled Clutter):
- Some boxes
- Minimal floor clutter

VISUAL STYLE SPECIFICATIONS:
- Art Style: Hi-bit pixel art with clean, crisp pixels and defined edges
- Color Palette: Cool, desaturated tones - muted blues, grey-greens, cold whites, desaturated browns
- Lighting: Overcast cold - creating subtle shadows and a slightly oppressive mood
- Atmosphere: chaotic energy flow - the room feels emotionally heavy but not filthy
- Texture: Visible pixel texture with deliberate, artistic dithering patterns

TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS:
- NO human characters or animals (furniture and objects only)
- NO text, labels, or UI elements
- NO glowing markers or indicators
- NO watermarks or signatures
- Room should look "lived-in but energetically imbalanced" rather than "disgustingly messy"

OUTPUT: Single 16:9 isometric pixel art image.
