## 完整提示词

```text
Create an isometric pixel art EXPANSIVE duplex apartment showing both floors in hi-bit style, inspired by games like Eastward or Coffee Talk. This is a feng shui puzzle game scene showing a room with problematic energy flow before corrections.

ROOM SCALE: EXPANSIVE (~90 square meters total, two-story duplex with staircase connecting floors)

The room is viewed from a 45-degree isometric angle, showing depth and dimension. This is a COMPLEX MULTI-LEVEL SPACE - the ultra-wide canvas shows the upper floor bedroom area with the staircase connecting to the lower living area visible below. The double-height space creates dramatic verticality. Multiple zones exist across two levels: upper bedroom, upper sitting area, stairs, lower living room partially visible.

SPATIAL COMPLEXITY: Two-story architecture with the staircase as a central visual element. The upper floor has a bedroom under a beam, a wardrobe with mirror, and the problematic "under-stairs" storage area. The ceiling has a sharp angle where the stairs meet the upper floor. Dark corners exist in the stairwell and under the staircase.

SCENE CONTEXT:
This is a "复式公寓二层" scenario. The room has a tense sleeping area atmosphere with Dim tense lighting. The space feels energetically imbalanced - not disastrously messy, but with subtle visual cues that something feels "off" about the layout.

CRITICAL SPATIAL LAYOUT - FOLLOW EXACTLY:

ZONE A - BED:
- Bed under beam
- CRITICAL: BEAM SHA

ZONE B - WARDROBE:
- Mirror on wardrobe
- CRITICAL: MIRROR SHA

ZONE C - STAIRS:
- Space under stairs
- CRITICAL: UNDER-STAIRS SHA

ZONE D - CORNER:
- Dark corner
- CRITICAL: YIN SHA

ZONE E - WARDROBE CORNER:
- Sharp corner
- CRITICAL: SHARP CORNER

FLOOR AND SURFACE DETAILS (Controlled Clutter):
- Minimal items
- Simple belongings

VISUAL STYLE SPECIFICATIONS:
- Art Style: Hi-bit pixel art with clean, crisp pixels and defined edges
- Color Palette: Cool, desaturated tones - muted blues, grey-greens, cold whites, desaturated browns
- Lighting: Dim tense - creating subtle shadows and a slightly oppressive mood
- Atmosphere: tense sleeping area - the room feels emotionally heavy but not filthy
- Texture: Visible pixel texture with deliberate, artistic dithering patterns

TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS:
- NO human characters or animals (furniture and objects only)
- NO text, labels, or UI elements
- NO glowing markers or indicators
- NO watermarks or signatures
- Room should look "lived-in but energetically imbalanced" rather than "disgustingly messy"

OUTPUT: Single 16:9 isometric pixel art image.
