## 完整提示词

```text
Create an isometric pixel art LARGE artist studio workspace in hi-bit style, inspired by games like Eastward or Coffee Talk. This is a feng shui puzzle game scene showing a room with problematic energy flow before corrections.

ROOM SCALE: LARGE (~75 square meters, spacious artist studio with multiple work zones)

The room is viewed from a 45-degree isometric angle, showing depth and dimension. This is an EXPANSIVE CREATIVE SPACE with distinct areas: main painting area with easel, supply storage, display corner, a small seating area, and a sink/cleaning corner. Large windows provide natural light. The high ceiling has exposed beams.

SPATIAL COMPLEXITY: Multi-purpose creative studio with at least 5 functional zones visible. The layout shows the chaotic creative process - paintings in progress, art supplies organized but accessible, and display areas. A ceiling beam runs across the main work area. There is a small bathroom/changing area visible. Dark corners exist where energy stagnates.

SCENE CONTEXT:
This is a "艺术家工作室" scenario. The room has a creative but blocked atmosphere with Dim blocked lighting. The space feels energetically imbalanced - not disastrously messy, but with subtle visual cues that something feels "off" about the layout.

CRITICAL SPATIAL LAYOUT - FOLLOW EXACTLY:

ZONE A - EASEL:
- Art easel
- CRITICAL: BEAM above

ZONE B - SHELF:
- Display shelf
- Sharp corner
- CRITICAL: SHARP CORNER

ZONE C - DARK CORNER:
- Dark area
- CRITICAL: YIN SHA

ZONE D - BATHROOM:
- Door visible
- CRITICAL: SMELL SHA

ZONE E - WINDOW:
- Large window
- CRITICAL: WINDOW SHA

FLOOR AND SURFACE DETAILS (Controlled Clutter):
- Art supplies
- Some paint tubes
- Canvases (neatly arranged)

VISUAL STYLE SPECIFICATIONS:
- Art Style: Hi-bit pixel art with clean, crisp pixels and defined edges
- Color Palette: Cool, desaturated tones - muted blues, grey-greens, cold whites, desaturated browns
- Lighting: Dim blocked - creating subtle shadows and a slightly oppressive mood
- Atmosphere: creative but blocked - the room feels emotionally heavy but not filthy
- Texture: Visible pixel texture with deliberate, artistic dithering patterns

TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS:
- NO human characters or animals (furniture and objects only)
- NO text, labels, or UI elements
- NO glowing markers or indicators
- NO watermarks or signatures
- Room should look "lived-in but energetically imbalanced" rather than "disgustingly messy"

OUTPUT: Single 16:9 isometric pixel art image.
