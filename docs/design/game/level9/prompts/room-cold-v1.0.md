## 完整提示词

```text
Create an isometric pixel art MEDIUM-SIZED attic bedroom with slanted ceiling in hi-bit style, inspired by games like Eastward or Coffee Talk. This is a feng shui puzzle game scene showing a room with problematic energy flow before corrections.

ROOM SCALE: MEDIUM (~40 square meters, spacious attic with unusual geometry)

The room is viewed from a 45-degree isometric angle, showing depth and dimension. This is a UNIQUE SPACE with a slanted ceiling - the room feels both spacious and intimate. The wider canvas shows more of the attic's unusual angles, including the dramatic roof slope, a large skylight, and dark corners created by the irregular walls.

SPATIAL COMPLEXITY: Irregular geometry with varying ceiling heights - one side of the room has full height while the other slopes down dramatically. The skylight creates harsh lighting contrasts, and there are multiple shadowy corners from the angled walls.

SCENE CONTEXT:
This is a "阁楼房间" scenario. The room has a cold damp evening atmosphere with Dim with harsh skylight lighting. The space feels energetically imbalanced - not disastrously messy, but with subtle visual cues that something feels "off" about the layout.

CRITICAL SPATIAL LAYOUT - FOLLOW EXACTLY:

ZONE A - BED:
- Bed under SLANTED CEILING
- CRITICAL: SLANTED CEILING SHA

ZONE B - SKYLIGHT:
- Large skylight above
- CRITICAL: WINDOW SHA

ZONE C - CORNER:
- Dark corner
- CRITICAL: YIN SHA

FLOOR AND SURFACE DETAILS (Controlled Clutter):
- Minimal items
- Simple bedding

VISUAL STYLE SPECIFICATIONS:
- Art Style: Hi-bit pixel art with clean, crisp pixels and defined edges
- Color Palette: Cool, desaturated tones - muted blues, grey-greens, cold whites, desaturated browns
- Lighting: Dim with harsh skylight - creating subtle shadows and a slightly oppressive mood
- Atmosphere: cold damp evening - the room feels emotionally heavy but not filthy
- Texture: Visible pixel texture with deliberate, artistic dithering patterns

TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS:
- NO human characters or animals (furniture and objects only)
- NO text, labels, or UI elements
- NO glowing markers or indicators
- NO watermarks or signatures
- Room should look "lived-in but energetically imbalanced" rather than "disgustingly messy"

OUTPUT: Single 16:9 isometric pixel art image.
