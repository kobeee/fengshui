## 完整提示词

```text
Create an isometric pixel art COMPACT gamer bedroom with setup in hi-bit style, inspired by games like Eastward or Coffee Talk. This is a feng shui puzzle game scene showing a room with problematic energy flow before corrections.

ROOM SCALE: COMPACT (~22 square meters, small bedroom with gaming setup)

The room is viewed from a 45-degree isometric angle, showing depth and dimension. This is a SMALL bedroom where a large gaming desk dominates the space. The bed is pushed to one side, and the room feels packed with gaming equipment, monitors, and RGB lighting. Typical of a dedicated gamer's personal space in a modest apartment.

SCENE CONTEXT:
This is a "游戏宅卧室" scenario. The room has a late night gaming session atmosphere with Dark with RGB glow lighting. The space feels energetically imbalanced - not disastrously messy, but with subtle visual cues that something feels "off" about the layout.

CRITICAL SPATIAL LAYOUT - FOLLOW EXACTLY:

ZONE A - BED:
- Bed with ceiling beam above
- CRITICAL: BEAM SHA

ZONE B - GAMING DESK:
- Sharp corner facing bed
- CRITICAL: SHARP CORNER SHA

FLOOR AND SURFACE DETAILS (Controlled Clutter):
- Gaming peripherals
- Some snack wrappers (few, not excessive)
- Headphones on desk

VISUAL STYLE SPECIFICATIONS:
- Art Style: Hi-bit pixel art with clean, crisp pixels and defined edges
- Color Palette: Cool, desaturated tones - muted blues, grey-greens, cold whites, desaturated browns
- Lighting: Dark with RGB glow - creating subtle shadows and a slightly oppressive mood
- Atmosphere: late night gaming session - the room feels emotionally heavy but not filthy
- Texture: Visible pixel texture with deliberate, artistic dithering patterns

TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS:
- NO human characters or animals (furniture and objects only)
- NO text, labels, or UI elements
- NO glowing markers or indicators
- NO watermarks or signatures
- Room should look "lived-in but energetically imbalanced" rather than "disgustingly messy"

OUTPUT: Single 16:9 isometric pixel art image.
