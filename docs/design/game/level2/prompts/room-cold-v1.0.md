## 完整提示词

```text
Create an isometric pixel art COMPACT cozy bedroom with cat elements in hi-bit style, inspired by games like Eastward or Coffee Talk. This is a feng shui puzzle game scene showing a room with problematic energy flow before corrections.

ROOM SCALE: COMPACT (~18 square meters, small bedroom with cat furniture)

The room is viewed from a 45-degree isometric angle, showing depth and dimension. This is a SMALL, INTIMATE bedroom where the bed, wardrobe with mirror, and cat tree are all within close proximity - typical of a cat lover's personal space in a small apartment.

SCENE CONTEXT:
This is a "猫奴的卧室" scenario. The room has a gloomy but warm-hearted cat lover atmosphere with Overcast grey afternoon lighting. The space feels energetically imbalanced - not disastrously messy, but with subtle visual cues that something feels "off" about the layout.

CRITICAL SPATIAL LAYOUT - FOLLOW EXACTLY:

ZONE A - BED:
- Bed with mirror on wardrobe opposite
- CRITICAL: Mirror faces bed creating MIRROR SHA

ZONE B - CAT AREA:
- Cat tree and cat bed

FLOOR AND SURFACE DETAILS (Controlled Clutter):
- Cat toys scattered (2-3 items, not excessive)
- Small cat bed in corner
- Books on nightstand

VISUAL STYLE SPECIFICATIONS:
- Art Style: Hi-bit pixel art with clean, crisp pixels and defined edges
- Color Palette: Cool, desaturated tones - muted blues, grey-greens, cold whites, desaturated browns
- Lighting: Overcast grey afternoon - creating subtle shadows and a slightly oppressive mood
- Atmosphere: gloomy but warm-hearted cat lover - the room feels emotionally heavy but not filthy
- Texture: Visible pixel texture with deliberate, artistic dithering patterns

TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS:
- NO human characters or animals (furniture and objects only)
- NO text, labels, or UI elements
- NO glowing markers or indicators
- NO watermarks or signatures
- Room should look "lived-in but energetically imbalanced" rather than "disgustingly messy"

OUTPUT: Single 16:9 isometric pixel art image.
