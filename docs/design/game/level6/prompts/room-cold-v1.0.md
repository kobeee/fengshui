## 完整提示词

```text
Create an isometric pixel art COMPACT startup studio office in hi-bit style, inspired by games like Eastward or Coffee Talk. This is a feng shui puzzle game scene showing a room with problematic energy flow before corrections.

ROOM SCALE: COMPACT (~30 square meters, small startup office space)

The room is viewed from a 45-degree isometric angle, showing depth and dimension. This is a SMALL, EFFICIENT office space typical of early-stage startups - one or two workstations, a whiteboard on the wall, minimal furniture. Everything is within arm's reach, creating an intense work-focused atmosphere.

SCENE CONTEXT:
This is a "创业工作室" scenario. The room has a busy chaotic startup atmosphere with Overcast grey morning lighting. The space feels energetically imbalanced - not disastrously messy, but with subtle visual cues that something feels "off" about the layout.

CRITICAL SPATIAL LAYOUT - FOLLOW EXACTLY:

ZONE A - WORK AREA:
- Desk with chair
- CRITICAL: Back faces door (BACK DOOR SHA)

ZONE B - PILLAR:
- Structural pillar with sharp corner
- CRITICAL: PILLAR SHA

FLOOR AND SURFACE DETAILS (Controlled Clutter):
- Some papers on desk
- Whiteboard markers
- Coffee cups (2-3, not excessive)

VISUAL STYLE SPECIFICATIONS:
- Art Style: Hi-bit pixel art with clean, crisp pixels and defined edges
- Color Palette: Cool, desaturated tones - muted blues, grey-greens, cold whites, desaturated browns
- Lighting: Overcast grey morning - creating subtle shadows and a slightly oppressive mood
- Atmosphere: busy chaotic startup - the room feels emotionally heavy but not filthy
- Texture: Visible pixel texture with deliberate, artistic dithering patterns

TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS:
- NO human characters or animals (furniture and objects only)
- NO text, labels, or UI elements
- NO glowing markers or indicators
- NO watermarks or signatures
- Room should look "lived-in but energetically imbalanced" rather than "disgustingly messy"

OUTPUT: Single 16:9 isometric pixel art image.
