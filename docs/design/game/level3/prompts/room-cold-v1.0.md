## 完整提示词

```text
Create an isometric pixel art COMPACT cramped student dormitory in hi-bit style, inspired by games like Eastward or Coffee Talk. This is a feng shui puzzle game scene showing a room with problematic energy flow before corrections.

ROOM SCALE: COMPACT (~15 square meters, very tight dormitory space)

The room is viewed from a 45-degree isometric angle, showing depth and dimension. This is the SMALLEST room type - a typical cramped student dorm where the bed, desk, and wardrobe are packed tightly together with minimal walking space. The ceiling feels low, creating a claustrophobic atmosphere typical of student housing.

SCENE CONTEXT:
This is a "学生宿舍" scenario. The room has a exam week stress atmosphere with Harsh fluorescent lighting. The space feels energetically imbalanced - not disastrously messy, but with subtle visual cues that something feels "off" about the layout.

CRITICAL SPATIAL LAYOUT - FOLLOW EXACTLY:

ZONE A - BED:
- Bunk bed or single bed

ZONE B - DESK:
- Sharp desk corner facing bed
- CRITICAL: SHARP CORNER SHA

FLOOR AND SURFACE DETAILS (Controlled Clutter):
- Study materials on desk
- Some textbooks
- Single coffee cup

VISUAL STYLE SPECIFICATIONS:
- Art Style: Hi-bit pixel art with clean, crisp pixels and defined edges
- Color Palette: Cool, desaturated tones - muted blues, grey-greens, cold whites, desaturated browns
- Lighting: Harsh fluorescent - creating subtle shadows and a slightly oppressive mood
- Atmosphere: exam week stress - the room feels emotionally heavy but not filthy
- Texture: Visible pixel texture with deliberate, artistic dithering patterns

TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS:
- NO human characters or animals (furniture and objects only)
- NO text, labels, or UI elements
- NO glowing markers or indicators
- NO watermarks or signatures
- Room should look "lived-in but energetically imbalanced" rather than "disgustingly messy"

OUTPUT: Single 16:9 isometric pixel art image.
