## 完整提示词

```text
Create an isometric pixel art LARGE children's bedroom in hi-bit style, inspired by games like Eastward or Coffee Talk. This is a feng shui puzzle game scene showing a room with problematic energy flow before corrections.

ROOM SCALE: LARGE (~55 square meters, spacious children's room with study and play areas)

The room is viewed from a 45-degree isometric angle, showing depth and dimension. This is a GENEROUSLY-SIZED children's room with multiple functional zones: sleeping area with bed, study area with desk, play area with toy storage, and a reading nook. The room has enough space for distinct activity zones that a child would use throughout the day.

SPATIAL COMPLEXITY: Multi-functional children's space with clear zones - the bed/sleeping area, a study corner with desk and bookshelf, a play area with toy boxes, and a window area. The ceiling has visible beams. A large mirror (wardrobe door) creates one of the sha problems. The room is well-organized but has multiple feng shui issues.

SCENE CONTEXT:
This is a "儿童房" scenario. The room has a playful but problematic atmosphere with Dim evening lighting. The space feels energetically imbalanced - not disastrously messy, but with subtle visual cues that something feels "off" about the layout.

CRITICAL SPATIAL LAYOUT - FOLLOW EXACTLY:

ZONE A - BED:
- Child bed
- CRITICAL: BEAM above

ZONE B - MIRROR:
- Mirror position
- CRITICAL: MIRROR SHA

ZONE C - BOOKSHELF:
- Sharp corner
- CRITICAL: SHARP CORNER

ZONE D - DOOR/WINDOW:
- Direct line
- CRITICAL: DOOR CLASH

FLOOR AND SURFACE DETAILS (Controlled Clutter):
- Toys (reasonable amount)
- Books
- Study materials

VISUAL STYLE SPECIFICATIONS:
- Art Style: Hi-bit pixel art with clean, crisp pixels and defined edges
- Color Palette: Cool, desaturated tones - muted blues, grey-greens, cold whites, desaturated browns
- Lighting: Dim evening - creating subtle shadows and a slightly oppressive mood
- Atmosphere: playful but problematic - the room feels emotionally heavy but not filthy
- Texture: Visible pixel texture with deliberate, artistic dithering patterns

TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS:
- NO human characters or animals (furniture and objects only)
- NO text, labels, or UI elements
- NO glowing markers or indicators
- NO watermarks or signatures
- Room should look "lived-in but energetically imbalanced" rather than "disgustingly messy"

OUTPUT: Single 16:9 isometric pixel art image.
