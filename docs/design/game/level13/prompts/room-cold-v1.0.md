## 完整提示词

```text
Create an isometric pixel art LARGE 10-person startup office in hi-bit style, inspired by games like Eastward or Coffee Talk. This is a feng shui puzzle game scene showing a room with problematic energy flow before corrections.

ROOM SCALE: LARGE (~80 square meters, full small office with multiple work areas)

The room is viewed from a 45-degree isometric angle, showing depth and dimension. This is a COMPREHENSIVE OFFICE VIEW showing a complete small office space. The wider canvas accommodates: main entrance, multiple desk clusters, a small meeting area, storage cabinets, windows along one wall, and visible ceiling beams. The office feels spacious but chaotic.

SPATIAL COMPLEXITY: Full office layout with clear functional zones - work area (multiple desks), meeting corner, entrance/reception area, and storage zone. Multiple ceiling beams create visual complexity. The wealth corner is in a prominent location. At least 6-8 desks are visible, creating visual density.

SCENE CONTEXT:
This is a "小型办公室" scenario. The room has a busy workday chaos atmosphere with Fluorescent harsh lighting. The space feels energetically imbalanced - not disastrously messy, but with subtle visual cues that something feels "off" about the layout.

CRITICAL SPATIAL LAYOUT - FOLLOW EXACTLY:

ZONE A - ENTRANCE:
- Door with direct line
- CRITICAL: DOOR CLASH

ZONE B - BEAM:
- Ceiling beam
- CRITICAL: BEAM SHA

ZONE C - WEALTH:
- Wealth corner
- CRITICAL: WEALTH SHA

ZONE D - CABINET:
- Sharp cabinet corner
- CRITICAL: SHARP CORNER

FLOOR AND SURFACE DETAILS (Controlled Clutter):
- Office supplies
- Some papers
- Minimal clutter

VISUAL STYLE SPECIFICATIONS:
- Art Style: Hi-bit pixel art with clean, crisp pixels and defined edges
- Color Palette: Cool, desaturated tones - muted blues, grey-greens, cold whites, desaturated browns
- Lighting: Fluorescent harsh - creating subtle shadows and a slightly oppressive mood
- Atmosphere: busy workday chaos - the room feels emotionally heavy but not filthy
- Texture: Visible pixel texture with deliberate, artistic dithering patterns

TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS:
- NO human characters or animals (furniture and objects only)
- NO text, labels, or UI elements
- NO glowing markers or indicators
- NO watermarks or signatures
- Room should look "lived-in but energetically imbalanced" rather than "disgustingly messy"

OUTPUT: Single 16:9 isometric pixel art image.
